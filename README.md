# Project 5: Brevet time calculator with Ajax and MongoDB

Brandon Do

## Functionality 
This application was created using Flask on the Backend, which is connected to a local instance of MongoDB, and AJAX, HTML, CSS on the front end.

The app creates rows that take KM or MILES as an input, where there are global "START TIME" and "BREVET DISTANCE" parameters. The beginning opening and close times for the brevets are calculated with respect to the variables above.
